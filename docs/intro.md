# Intro to Grid-Data-Models
GDM is a Python package containing data models for distribution system assets and datasets. This package is actively being developed at [National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)](https://www.nrel.gov/).

## Why Grid Data Models?

To reduce code duplication and provide client packages with a standard interface to interact with power system data, a group of research engineers at NREL is developing standard data models. Features include:

- **Built-in Validation Layer:** The use of [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) allows for the validation of model fields.
- **Time Series Data Management:** GDM uses the [infrasys](https://github.nrel.gov/CADET/infrastructure_systems) package, enabling [efficient time series data management](https://nrel.github.io/infrasys/explanation/time_series.html) by sharing arrays across components and offloading system memory. For example, time series power consumption data can be attached to a load profile.
- **Built-in Unit Conversion:** GDM leverages [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for unit conversion of power system quantities, such as power, voltage, and time.
- **JSON Serialization/Deserialization:** GDM uses [infrasys](https://github.com/NREL/infrasys) to serialize and deserialize distribution system components to/from JSON.
- **Track System Changes:** Supports tracking changes within a distribution model (both temporal and scenario-based static updates), enabling powerful scenario management capabilities.
- **Graph-Based Analysis:** Exposes a connectivity graph using NetworkX, allowing advanced graph-based algorithms and visualizations.
- **Model Reduction:** Built-in support for multiple model reduction algorithms.
- **Interoperability:** Easily integrates with existing tools.

## The GDM Ecosystem

- **Grid-Data-Models:** Foundational models for distribution system analysis.
- **Shift:** Builds synthetic distribution models in GDM format.
- **DiTto:** Model conversion framework, refactored with GDM models now representing DiTto core.
- **ERAD:** Resilience analysis of distribution systems, taking in hazard models and GDM models as input.
- **Cadet-OPT / Cadet-MDAO:** Distribution system optimization frameworks.
- **GridAI:** Builds training datasets for PyTorch for generative AI applications from GDM base models.
- **GridDB:** Distribution asset cost database, currently being built, will map to GDM equipment models.
- **DistLLM:** LLM interface for the entire distribution suite ecosystem.
