These include commercial formats such as CYME, Synergi, DEW, ePHASORSIM as well as open source formats such as OpenDSS and GridLAB-D. DiTTo consists of an API which represents electrical equipment, configurations, settings and timeseries data. This API acts as an intermediary between different distribution model formats. Several modules for reading and writing the models connect to this API to facilitate easy conversion between formats. Once feeder models are converted into the intermediate API, analysis can be done on the feeder using a network module. The modification module allows changes to be made to the model in the intermediate API. This allows a clear workflow that supports reading a model from one format, performing analysis, making modifications and writing the model to a different format.},

  title        = {A Comprehensive Review of Practical Issues for Interoperability Using the Common Information Model in Smart Grids},
  annote       = {Smart grids with interoperability improve grid reliability by collecting system information and transferring it to an energy management system and associated applications through a seamless end-to-end connection. To achieve interoperability, it is required to exchange the semantic information within the different domains. The international electrotechnical commission has established the Common Information Model (CIM) tool, which is a standard application programming interface for the exchange of semantic information in power systems. CIM provides a robust framework for accurate data sharing, merging, and transformation into reusable information. However, as CIM provides a basic framework for information exchange, various practical issues arise in establishing an energy management system capable of exchanging information using CIM. This paper aims to offer a comprehensive understanding by summarizing and categorizing the research on the practical use of CIM for interoperability in smart grids. Many papers are analyzed and the issues are classified into CIM extension, harmonization, and validation to address the issues that arise when establishing an integrated information exchange system.},
